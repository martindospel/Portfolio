### About me
##### In the first section of the portfolio, I share a little bit about me and my passions.

I was born in Slovakia and raised in the UK where I obtained my International Relations degree. In the following years, I worked in 3 different countries, and in 3 different industries. At a pivotal moment, I decided to listen to what I was really passionate about. That's when I decided I had to become a software developer.

### Projects
##### In this section, I showcase some of the projects and code that I've been working on and some that I am preparing for. 

1. _TrackMate_ - A **React** app built for teachers to track absence, performance and behaviour of students. (Links to the [Code](https://github.com/martindospel/final-project-client) and the [Website](https://track-mate.netlify.app/))
2. _TrackMate V2_ - I am currently collaborating on a second version of TrackMate which will be more dynamic. It will be built with a **React Native** frontend, **Firebase** authentication and **Golang** backend. (Link to the [Code](https://github.com/sayedmurtaza24/trackmatev2))
3. _Go REST API_ - I built a small RESTful API with **Golang** and SQLite, a relational database. (Link to the [Code](https://github.com/martindospel/REST-API-with-GO))
4. _Unsplash Pepper_ - A very simple image searching tool using the Unsplash API. (Links to the [Code](https://github.com/martindospel/unsplash-pepper-react) and the [Website](http://unsplash-pepperjs.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/))
